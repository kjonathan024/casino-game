This is where I will be writing my ideas:

1: Casino Game - add different casino games and make OOP
features, such as the player's cash amounts and perhaps even
for certain games for there to be a leveling system.

Features:
    - Player class with levels for each of the games, money
    - Blackjack (maybe add for leveling the ability to "feel lucky" on a next card)
    - Horse racing (generate horse objects with random speed stats)
    - Dice
